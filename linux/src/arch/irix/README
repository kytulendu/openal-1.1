The following configuration options could be specified
in the ~/.openalrc file:

1. You can now define up to four output channels.
2. You can specify which output port or interface to use.
3. For systems that don't support 4 channel audio natively
   you can specify a second device that is used for the rear
   channels.

A typical O2 configuration file would look like this:

(define speaker-num 4)
(define native-out-device "Analog Out")
(define native-rear-out-device "Analog Out 2")

or alternatively:

(define speaker-num 4)
(define native-out-device "A3.Speaker")
(define native-rear-out-device "A3.LineOut2")
